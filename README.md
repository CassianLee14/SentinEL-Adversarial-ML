# 🛡️ SentinEL: Ultima Intelligence Engine

### Next-Gen Phishing Detection using Explainable AI (XAI)
**Architects:** Mourya R. Udumula & Jeet Upadhyaya | **Institution:** Indrashil University

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
SentinEL Ultima is a **Hybrid Threat Intelligence Engine** designed to detect sophisticated phishing attacks that bypass traditional blacklists. It combines a high-speed **Random Forest** classifier with real-time **Forensic Analysis** (WHOIS, DNS, SSL) to deliver verdicts with <150ms latency.

The system features **Active Learning**, allowing security analysts to flag false positives and retrain the decision boundary in real-time (Session Scope).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
*   **ML Core:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Pipelines), Pandas
*   **Forensics:** `python-whois`, `dnspython`, SSL Socket Inspection
*   **Concurrency:** `concurrent.futures` for high-velocity batch triage
*   **Interface:** Streamlit (Dynamic Dashboard)

## ⚡ Key Capabilities
1.  **Hybrid Engine:** Combines Allowlisting (O(1) lookup) with ML Heuristics.
2.  **Explainable AI (XAI):** Provides human-readable reasons for every verdict (e.g., "High Entropy", "Expired SSL").
3.  **Resilience:** Self-healing CSV parsing logic for handling dirty IOC feeds.
4.  **Adversarial Defense:** Detects DGA (Domain Generation Algorithms) via Shannon Entropy analysis.
